Reader Content-Negotiation
==========================

This software suite describes and demonstrates how to apply an HTTP application programmer interface called "content-negotiation" against the root as well as the underlying content of http://carrels.distantreader.org. Equipped with a knowledge of this interface, the developer will be able to compute against Distant Reader content in whatever programming language they desire. More importantly, the developer will be able to read, use, understand, and create alternative interfaces to the 100's of thousands of items in the Reader's library.
