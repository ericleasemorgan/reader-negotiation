Reader Content-Negotiation
==========================

This software suite describes and demonstrates how to apply an HTTP application programmer interface against the root of http://carrels.distantreader.org as well as its underlying content. Equipped with the knowledge of this interface, a developer will be able to compute against Distant Reader content in whatever programming language they desire. More importantly, the developer will be able to read, use, and understand the 100's of thousands of items the Reader's library has to offer.
